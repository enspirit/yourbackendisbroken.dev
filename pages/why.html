  <h1>Let's improve all backends</h1>
  <p>As we continuously worked on software for years, we came to the conclusion
     that many teams could improve their software quality through better
     design & black-box testing of backend components.</p>
  <h2>A backend is broken when &hellip;</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>It becomes harder and harder to maintain and make evolve,</li>
    <li>or breaks its clients when released,</li>
    <li>or throws 500 errors when something is unexpected,</li>
    <li>or exposes technical details on errors,</li>
    <li>or has recurrent performance problems,</li>
    <li>or requires looking at the code to discover the services.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Hidden costs of broken backends</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Your team is 10 times slower than it could be.</li>
    <li>Your backend will eventually be rewritten from scratch.</li>
    <li>A deadly security nightmare waits around the corner.</li>
    <li>You miss an opportunity to think clearly about your software.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Testing is incomplete in most teams</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Unit tests are fined-grained, and may be too brittle.</li>
    <li>Integration testing is technically hard, most teams skip it.</li>
    <li>End-to-end testing is often slow, and focuses on best case scenarios.</li>
    <li>Functional black-box testing is ... generally unknown.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Web services offer an opportunity to improve quality</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Web services correspond to high-level software operations.</li>
    <li>They offer a natural space for stable design.</li>
    <li>Being public by nature, they call for robustness & security analysis.</li>
    <li>The HTTP protocol is standard and technology agnostic.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>We provide an open-source framework where&hellip;</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Web services are specified in a friendly, yet formal way.</li>
    <li>Checking if they meet their specification is as easy as using <code>curl</code>.</li>
    <li>PRE/POST contracts provide systematic testing coverage.</li>
    <li>A specification can also be used for documentation, API mocking, code generation, etc.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>It's different from existing alternatives</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Our first focus is on testing & quality, not documentation or UI tools.</li>
    <li>Specifications are independent from the implementation, not derived from it.</li>
    <li>Therefore they are human-centric, not machine-centric.</li>
    <li>A <code>spec</code> is a <code>spec</code>, not a usage scenario.</li>
  </ol>
